# Spin Glass Observables Codes

This repository contains the codes, raw data, data analysis scripts, and processed data files for computing and analyzing observables in spin glass models.

## Repository organization

- `.venv`, `.vscode`  
  Configuration folders for Python virtual environments and Visual Studio Code settings. These are not required for running analysis or simulation codes.

- `dati_2point_disc_amp/`  
- `dati_2point_disc_LL2LL_new/`  
- `dati_2point_disc_LLLL_new/`  
- `dati_2pointL2L/`  
- `dati_2pointLL/`  
- `dati_3pointL2L2L/`  
- `dati_3pointL2L3L/`  
- `dati_3pointLL2L/`  
- `dati_3pointLLL/`  
- `dati_barevertex/`  
- `dati_PJ/`  
  These folders contain the unprocessed (raw) data generated by the simulation codes.

- `2point_*.c`, `3point_*.c`  
  These C codes generate the raw data in the corresponding `dati_*` folders.  
  For example, `2point_disc_LLLL.c` generates files in `dati_2point_disc_LLLL_new/`.

- `analysis_2point_bare.c`, `analysis_2pointL2L.c`, `analysis_2pointLL.c`  
  C codes for analyzing the 2-point connected observables. They process the generated data and produce output to the `some_data_analysis` subfolders.

- `some_data_analysis/`  
  This folder collects all data analysis scripts, processed data, and summary notebooks. Inside:  
    - `analisi_dati_2point/`  
    - `analisi_dati_3point/`  
    - `analisi_dati_disc_loop_amp_lc/`  
    - `analisi_dati_disc_loop_lc/`  
    - `analisi_dati_PJ/`  
      These contain the outputs of the various analysis codes.  
    - `2point_disc_analysis_codes/`  
    - `3point_analysis_codes/`  
      These directories contain Python scripts or Jupyter notebooks for analyzing the 2-point disconnected and all 3-point observables, respectively.  
    - `Extrapolation_a_parameter.ipynb`  
    - `Extrapolation_lambda_parameter.ipynb`  
      Jupyter notebooks that perform extrapolation analysis of the "a" and "lambda" parameters, using processed data from the `analisi_dati_*` directories.  
    - `paper_fit_codes/`  
      Jupyter notebooks for global fits of the three observables (2-point connected, 2-point disconnected, 3-point connected), using data from the `analisi_dati_*` folders.

## Notes

- File and folder names are sometimes in Italian; names are kept as originally used to ensure compatibility with all existing codes and scripts.  
- Usually, the workflow is as follows:  
  1. Compile and run the appropriate C code to generate raw data in `dati_*` folders.  
  2. Analyze the raw data using the C analysis codes (for 2-point connected) or Python scripts/notebooks (in `some_data_analysis/2point_disc_analysis_codes/` and `some_data_analysis/3point_analysis_codes/`).  
  3. The processed results are found in the respective `analisi_dati_*` folders.  
  4. For extrapolations and paper-level fits, use the Jupyter notebooks in `some_data_analysis/`.

For any questions, refer to the comments in the individual codes or contact the repository maintainer.
